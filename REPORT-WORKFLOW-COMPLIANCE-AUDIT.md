# Report Management Workflow Compliance Audit

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Scope**: All report-related endpoints  
**Reference**: workflow.md specifications

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **All report endpoints now comply 100% with workflow.md specifications**

### Critical Fixes Applied:

1. **Report Status Transitions** - Fixed declined report status from 'draft' to 'declined'
2. **Declined Report Editing** - Enabled editing of declined reports for revision workflow
3. **Resubmission Workflow** - Submit endpoint now accepts both draft and declined reports

---

## Workflow Specification Analysis

### Report Status Flow (from workflow.md)

```
Draft → Pending → Approved/Declined/Archived
         ↑              ↓
         └── Revision ←──┘
```

**Status Enum**: `'draft','pending','approved','declined','archived'`

### Business Rules

1. **Draft Reports**:
   - PCO can edit, not visible to admin
   - Only PCO who created can access
   - Can be deleted

2. **Pending Reports**:
   - Submitted by PCO, awaiting admin review
   - Read-only for PCO
   - Admin can approve, decline, or archive

3. **Approved Reports**:
   - Final report, can be emailed to clients
   - Immutable (cannot be edited by anyone)

4. **Declined Reports** (CRITICAL):
   - Returned to PCO with admin notes
   - **PCO MUST be able to edit** to fix issues
   - Can be resubmitted (status: declined → pending)
   - PCO is reassigned to client for revision

5. **Archived Reports**:
   - Completed but not for client distribution
   - Immutable

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Incorrect Status on Decline ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Problem**: When admin declined a report, status was set to `'draft'` instead of `'declined'`

**Location**: `declineReport()` controller (line ~840)

**Before**:
```typescript
// Decline report - return to draft status per workflow.md
await executeQuery(
  `UPDATE reports 
   SET status = 'draft',
       admin_notes = ?,
       reviewed_by = ?,
       reviewed_at = NOW()
   WHERE id = ? AND status = 'pending'`,
  [admin_notes, adminId, reportId]
);
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Decline report - set to 'declined' status per workflow.md
// Status: pending → declined (PCO can then edit and resubmit)
await executeQuery(
  `UPDATE reports 
   SET status = 'declined',
       admin_notes = ?,
       reviewed_by = ?,
       reviewed_at = NOW()
   WHERE id = ? AND status = 'pending'`,
  [admin_notes, adminId, reportId]
);
```

**Impact**: 
- Reports now correctly show as 'declined' in database
- Matches workflow diagram and business rules
- Preserves audit trail (reviewed_by and reviewed_at remain set)

---

### Issue 2: Declined Reports Cannot Be Edited ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Problem**: All editing endpoints only allowed `status = 'draft'`, blocking the revision workflow

**Affected Endpoints** (9 total):
1. `PUT /api/pco/reports/:id` - Update main report
2. `POST /api/pco/reports/:id/bait-stations` - Add bait station
3. `PUT /api/pco/reports/:id/bait-stations/:stationId` - Update bait station
4. `DELETE /api/pco/reports/:id/bait-stations/:stationId` - Delete bait station
5. `PUT /api/pco/reports/:id/fumigation` - Update fumigation data
6. `POST /api/pco/reports/:id/insect-monitors` - Add insect monitor
7. `PUT /api/pco/reports/:id/insect-monitors/:monitorId` - Update insect monitor
8. `DELETE /api/pco/reports/:id/insect-monitors/:monitorId` - Delete insect monitor
9. (Exception: `DELETE /api/pco/reports/:id` - correctly only allows draft deletion)

**Before Pattern**:
```typescript
// Only allowed draft status
WHERE status = 'draft'
```

**After Pattern**:
```typescript
// Now allows both draft and declined
WHERE status IN ('draft', 'declined')
```

**Example Fix - updateReport()**:
```typescript
// BEFORE
const reportCheck = await executeQuery<RowDataPacket[]>(
  `SELECT id FROM reports WHERE id = ? AND pco_id = ? AND status = 'draft'`,
  [reportId, pcoId]
);

if (reportCheck.length === 0) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Report not found, not owned by you, or cannot be edited (only drafts can be edited)'
  });
}

// AFTER
const reportCheck = await executeQuery<RowDataPacket[]>(
  `SELECT id FROM reports WHERE id = ? AND pco_id = ? AND status IN ('draft', 'declined')`,
  [reportId, pcoId]
);

if (reportCheck.length === 0) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Report not found, not owned by you, or not editable (only draft and declined reports can be edited)'
  });
}
```

**Impact**:
- PCO can now edit declined reports to address admin feedback
- All sub-modules (bait stations, fumigation, insect monitors) editable
- Completes the revision workflow loop

---

### Issue 3: Resubmission Not Allowed for Declined Reports

**Problem**: `submitReport()` only accepted `status = 'draft'`, preventing resubmission

**Location**: `submitReport()` controller (line ~692)

**Before**:
```typescript
// Verify ownership and draft status (per workflow.md)
const reportCheck = await executeQuery<RowDataPacket[]>(
  `SELECT r.*, c.company_name
   FROM reports r
   JOIN clients c ON r.client_id = c.id
   WHERE r.id = ? AND r.pco_id = ? AND r.status = 'draft'`,
  [reportId, pcoId]
);
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Verify ownership and draft/declined status (per workflow.md)
// Declined reports can be resubmitted after corrections
const reportCheck = await executeQuery<RowDataPacket[]>(
  `SELECT r.*, c.company_name
   FROM reports r
   JOIN clients c ON r.client_id = c.id
   WHERE r.id = ? AND r.pco_id = ? AND r.status IN ('draft', 'declined')`,
  [reportId, pcoId]
);
```

**Impact**:
- PCO can resubmit declined reports after editing
- Status transitions: declined → pending (on resubmission)
- Completes the feedback loop: Admin Declines → PCO Edits → PCO Resubmits → Admin Reviews Again

## Complete Revision Workflow (Now Working)

### Step 1: Admin Declines Report
```bash
POST /api/admin/reports/123/decline
Body: { "admin_notes": "Please add more detail to bait station remarks." }

# System Actions:
# - Report status: pending → declined ✅
# - Admin notes saved
# - Reviewed_by and reviewed_at recorded
# - PCO reassigned to client
# - Notification sent to PCO
```

### Step 2: PCO Views Declined Report
```bash
GET /api/pco/reports/123

Response:
{
  "id": 123,
  "status": "declined",
  "admin_notes": "Please add more detail to bait station remarks.",
  "reviewed_at": "2025-10-14T10:30:00Z",
  "reviewed_by": 7
}
```

### Step 3: PCO Edits Report to Address Feedback
```bash
# Update main report
PUT /api/pco/reports/123
Body: { "general_remarks": "Added detailed pest identification..." }

# Update bait station
PUT /api/pco/reports/123/bait-stations/5
Body: { "station_remarks": "Found cockroach droppings near Station BS-001..." }

# Add more data if needed
POST /api/pco/reports/123/bait-stations
Body: { ... }
```

### Step 4: PCO Resubmits Report
```bash
POST /api/pco/reports/123/submit

# System Actions:
# - Report status: declined → pending ✅
# - Submitted_at updated to current timestamp
# - PCO auto-unassigned from client (per workflow)
# - Notification sent to admin
```

### Step 5: Admin Reviews Resubmitted Report
```bash
# If satisfied:
POST /api/admin/reports/123/approve
Body: { "admin_notes": "Approved. Good work addressing feedback." }

# System Actions:
# - Report status: pending → approved
# - Report becomes immutable
# - Can be emailed to client
```

---

## Additional Workflow Compliance Checks

### ✅ Auto-Unassignment on Submission
- Verified: `submitReport()` calls `SubmitReport()` stored procedure
- Procedure handles PCO auto-unassignment from client
- Matches workflow spec: "PCO assignment automatically removed after report submission"

### ✅ Reassignment on Decline
- Verified: `declineReport()` reassigns PCO to client
- Query: `UPDATE client_pco_assignments SET status = 'active'`
- Matches workflow spec: "CRITICAL: Reassign PCO to client for revision"

### ✅ Notification System
- Verified: Notifications inserted on submit and decline
- Types: 'report_submitted', 'report_declined'
- Matches workflow spec: Push notifications for PCO mobile app

### ✅ Draft Deletion
- Verified: Only drafts can be deleted
- Declined/pending/approved reports cannot be deleted (data integrity)
- Matches business rule: "Hard Delete: Only if no associated reports exist"

### ✅ Admin Cannot See Drafts
- Verified: `getAdminReports()` excludes drafts
- Query: `WHERE status != 'draft'`
- Matches workflow spec: "Draft: PCO can edit, not visible to admin"

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Complete Revision Cycle
```
1. Create draft report as PCO
2. Submit report (status: draft → pending)
3. Decline report as admin with notes (status: pending → declined) ✅
4. Verify PCO can view declined report with admin notes
5. Edit declined report as PCO (all sub-modules) ✅
6. Resubmit declined report (status: declined → pending) ✅
7. Approve resubmitted report (status: pending → approved)
```

### Test Case 2: Edit Restrictions
```
1. Create and submit report
2. As PCO, attempt to edit pending report → Should FAIL ❌
3. Admin declines report
4. As PCO, attempt to edit declined report → Should SUCCEED ✅
5. Resubmit report
6. As PCO, attempt to edit pending report again → Should FAIL ❌
7. Admin approves report
8. As PCO, attempt to edit approved report → Should FAIL ❌
```

### Test Case 3: Delete Restrictions
```
1. Create draft report → Can delete ✅
2. Submit report (status: pending) → Cannot delete ❌
3. Admin declines report (status: declined) → Cannot delete ❌
4. Admin approves report (status: approved) → Cannot delete ❌
```
