## ⚠️ What's Missing (8% - 6 gaps)

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Blocks core workflow features)

#### 1. PDF Report Generation ❌
- **Missing:** `GET /admin/reports/:id/pdf`
- **Impact:** Admin cannot generate client-ready PDF reports
- **Workaround:** Display HTML preview for now
- **Estimate:** 2-3 days (implement pdfkit or puppeteer)

#### 2. Email Reports to Clients ❌
- **Missing:** `POST /admin/reports/:id/email`
- **Impact:** Admin must manually email reports outside system
- **Workaround:** Show "Coming soon" button
- **Estimate:** 1-2 days (nodemailer integration)

#### 3. Auto-Unassign PCO After Submission ⚠️
- **Current:** Manual unassignment required
- **Impact:** Extra admin workload
- **Workaround:** Show reminder to admin
- **Estimate:** 2 hours (add logic to submit endpoint)

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Reduces efficiency)

#### 4. Auto-Notification Triggers ⚠️
- **Current:** Admin must manually send notifications
- **Events:** Assignment, report submission, declination
- **Impact:** PCOs may miss updates
- **Workaround:** Manual notification sending works
- **Estimate:** 4-6 hours (add triggers to business logic)

#### 5. Email Notifications to Admin ❌
- **Missing:** Email service for admin alerts
- **Impact:** Admin must check dashboard constantly
- **Workaround:** In-app notifications only
- **Estimate:** 1 day (email templates + cron jobs)

#### 6. Single Report JSON Export ⚠️
- **Current:** Only full data export available
- **Missing:** `GET /pco/reports/:id/export`
- **Impact:** Limited offline backup granularity
- **Workaround:** Use full data export
- **Estimate:** 2 hours (add export endpoint)
