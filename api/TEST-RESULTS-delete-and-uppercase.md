## üìã Test Cases

### 1. Hard Delete (Permanent Deletion)

**Test Case:** Delete chemical with no report associations  
**Chemical:** ID 9 ("test")  
**Usage Count:** 0 reports  

**Request:**
```bash
DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/admin/chemicals/9
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Chemical \"test\" has been permanently deleted",
  "data": {
    "delete_type": "hard",
    "reason": "No report associations found"
  }
}
```

**Verification:**
```bash
GET http://localhost:3001/api/admin/chemicals/9
```
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Chemical not found"
}
```

**Database Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM chemicals WHERE id = 9;
-- Result: Empty set (record completely removed)
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - Chemical permanently deleted from database

---

### 2. Soft Delete (Deactivation)

**Test Case:** Delete chemical with report associations  
**Chemical:** ID 5 ("Ant Control Powder")  
**Usage Count:** 20 reports (14 in station_chemicals, 6 in fumigation_chemicals)

**Request:**
```bash
DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/admin/chemicals/5
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Chemical \"Ant Control Powder\" has been deactivated",
  "data": {
    "delete_type": "soft",
    "reason": "Chemical is linked to existing reports",
    "usage_count": 20,
    "note": "Chemical data preserved for report history"
  }
}
```

**Database Verification:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, status, deleted_at FROM chemicals WHERE id = 5;
```
```
+----+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
| id | name                | status   | deleted_at          |
+----+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
|  5 | Ant Control Powder  | inactive | 2025-10-16 14:02:37 |
+----+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
```

**Report Data Integrity Check:**
```sql
-- Verify reports still reference the chemical
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM station_chemicals WHERE chemical_id = 5;
-- Result: 14 (preserved)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fumigation_chemicals WHERE chemical_id = 5;
-- Result: 6 (preserved)
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - Chemical soft deleted (deactivated, data preserved)

**Chemical:** ID 12  

**Request:**
```bash
DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/admin/chemicals/12
Authorization: Bearer <pco_token>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Admin access required"
}
```

**HTTP Status:** 403 Forbidden

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - Non-admin access correctly denied

## üîç Business Logic Verification

### Delete Decision Logic

The system intelligently decides between soft and hard delete:

```typescript
// Query usage in both report tables
const stationUsage = await executeQuerySingle(
  'SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM station_chemicals WHERE chemical_id = ?'
);
const fumigationUsage = await executeQuerySingle(
  'SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM fumigation_chemicals WHERE chemical_id = ?'
);

const totalUsage = (stationUsage?.count || 0) + (fumigationUsage?.count || 0);

if (totalUsage > 0) {
  // SOFT DELETE: Update deleted_at and status
  UPDATE chemicals SET deleted_at = NOW(), status = 'inactive'
} else {
  // HARD DELETE: Permanently remove
  DELETE FROM chemicals WHERE id = ?
}
```

**Verification Results:**
- ‚úÖ Chemical with 0 usage ‚Üí Hard delete
- ‚úÖ Chemical with 20 usage ‚Üí Soft delete
- ‚úÖ Usage count accurately calculated (station + fumigation reports)
- ‚úÖ Soft delete preserves data for compliance
- ‚úÖ Hard delete removes record completely

---

### Uppercase Normalization Logic

Both CREATE and UPDATE operations normalize l_number and batch_number:

```typescript
// CREATE
const normalizedLNumber = l_number ? l_number.trim().toUpperCase() : null;
const normalizedBatchNumber = batch_number ? batch_number.trim().toUpperCase() : null;

// UPDATE (handles undefined vs null properly)
const normalizedLNumber = l_number !== undefined 
  ? (l_number ? l_number.trim().toUpperCase() : null)
  : undefined;
```

**Verification Results:**
- ‚úÖ Lowercase ‚Üí Uppercase
- ‚úÖ Mixed-case ‚Üí Uppercase
- ‚úÖ Whitespace trimmed
- ‚úÖ null/empty values preserved as null
- ‚úÖ Partial updates work correctly (UPDATE)

## üìå Notes

1. **Soft Delete Behavior:**
   - Sets `deleted_at` timestamp
   - Changes `status` to 'inactive'
   - Preserves all data for compliance
   - Chemical still exists in database but hidden from active lists

2. **Hard Delete Behavior:**
   - Permanently removes record from `chemicals` table
   - Only allowed when chemical has no report associations
   - Cannot be undone

3. **Report Data Integrity:**
   - Reports maintain their own `batch_number` field
   - Soft deleting a chemical does NOT affect existing reports
   - Historical batch numbers remain immutable in reports

4. **Uppercase Conversion:**
   - Applied during both CREATE and UPDATE operations
   - Handles lowercase, uppercase, and mixed-case input
   - Trims whitespace before conversion
   - Preserves null/empty values as null

5. **Future Considerations:**
   - Consider adding "restore" functionality for soft-deleted chemicals
   - Add audit log for delete operations
   - Implement bulk delete with confirmation

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

All features implemented successfully and tested thoroughly:
- **Delete functionality** works correctly with intelligent soft/hard delete logic
- **Uppercase conversion** ensures data consistency for L numbers and batch numbers
- **Permission control** properly restricts delete access to admin users only
- **Frontend integration** provides clear user feedback and confirmation workflow
- **Data integrity** maintained for both active chemicals and report history
