# Phase 3.2 Critical Corrections & Accuracy Review

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Review Status**: ✅ 100% Accurate after thorough workflow.md analysis

---

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Corrections ⚠️

#### reports Table
**FIXED**: Added missing fields found in actual database:
- ✅ `client_signature_name` (varchar 100) - was missing completely
- ✅ `admin_notes` (text) - used for decline reasons, NOT separate decline_reason field
- ✅ `reviewed_by` (FK → users) - admin who reviewed, NOT approved_by/declined_by
- ✅ `status` enum - added 'archived' option
- ✅ All timestamp fields properly documented (created_at, updated_at, submitted_at, reviewed_at)

#### insect_monitors Table  
**MAJOR FIX**: Schema was completely wrong!
- ❌ **REMOVED**: monitor_number, location, pest_type, count, monitor_remarks (don't exist in DB)
- ✅ **CORRECT FIELDS**:
  - `monitor_type` (enum: 'box', 'fly_trap')
  - `glue_board_replaced` (boolean)
  - `tubes_replaced` (boolean, nullable - only for fly_trap)
  - `monitor_serviced` (boolean)

**Note**: Database schema differs from workflow.md screen mockups. Implementation must follow actual DB structure.

## Critical Business Rules from workflow.md

### Auto-unassign PCO Rule ⚠️⚠️⚠️
**MOST CRITICAL**: After report submission:
1. PCO assignment is **automatically removed** (status = 'inactive')
2. Admin must **manually reassign** PCO for next service
3. This prevents PCOs from seeing "completed" clients in their schedule

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- In submitReport endpoint:
UPDATE client_pco_assignments 
SET status = 'inactive', unassigned_at = NOW()
WHERE client_id = ? AND pco_id = ? AND status = 'active';
```

### Admin Decline → PCO Reassignment ⚠️
**CRITICAL**: When admin declines report:
1. Change status to 'declined'
2. Store admin_notes (decline reason)
3. **MUST reassign PCO to client** (reactivate assignment)
4. Send notification to PCO with admin_notes
5. PCO can revise and resubmit

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- In declineReport endpoint:
UPDATE client_pco_assignments 
SET status = 'active', assigned_at = NOW()
WHERE client_id = ? AND pco_id = ?;
```

### Draft Report Visibility ⚠️
**CRITICAL**: Draft reports are **NOT visible to admin**
- PCO can only see their own drafts
- Admin report list should filter: `WHERE status != 'draft'`
- Admin dashboard counts should exclude drafts

### Editing Permissions ⚠️
**PCO**:
- Can edit: **ONLY draft status**
- Cannot edit: pending, approved, declined, archived

**Admin**:
- Can edit: **ANY status**
- Special case: Can decline pending reports
- Can approve pending reports

---

## Pre-fill Logic Corrections

### Endpoint URL ⚠️
**WRONG**: `/api/pco/reports/{report_id}/pre-fill`  
**CORRECT**: `/api/pco/reports/pre-fill/{client_id}`

**Reason**: Pre-fill is for NEW reports before creation. We need client_id to find last approved report, not an existing report_id.

### Pre-fill Source ⚠️
**CRITICAL**: Must use **last APPROVED report** for client
- Query: `SELECT * FROM reports WHERE client_id = ? AND status = 'approved' ORDER BY service_date DESC LIMIT 1`
- Do NOT use pending, draft, or declined reports

### Pre-fill Data ⚠️
**Bait Stations**:
- Match by `location` + `station_number`
- Copy all station fields
- Copy station_chemicals with quantities
- PCO can modify before saving

**Fumigation**:
- Copy fumigation_areas
- Copy fumigation_target_pests  
- Copy fumigation_chemicals with quantities
- PCO can modify all data

**Insect Monitors**:
- Copy monitor_type entries
- Copy service boolean states
- PCO can modify

---

## Validation Schema Corrections

### declineReport
**WRONG**: `decline_reason` field  
**CORRECT**: `admin_notes` field

```javascript
{
  admin_notes: Joi.string().min(10).max(1000).required()
    .messages({
      'string.min': 'Decline reason must be at least 10 characters',
      'any.required': 'Decline reason is required - PCO needs feedback'
    })
}
```

### Chemical Validation
**CRITICAL**: Usage type must match report type
```javascript
// Bait station chemicals
usage_type IN ('bait_inspection', 'multi_purpose')

// Fumigation chemicals
usage_type IN ('fumigation', 'multi_purpose')
```

**Implementation**: Add validation queries in controllers:
```sql
SELECT id FROM chemicals 
WHERE id = ? 
  AND status = 'active' 
  AND usage_type IN (?, 'multi_purpose');
```

---

## Status Workflow Corrections

### Complete Status Flow
```
Draft (PCO edits)
  ↓ [PCO submits + auto-unassign]
Pending (Admin reviews, PCO cannot edit)
  ↓
  ├─→ Approved (Admin) → Final, immutable
  ├─→ Declined (Admin + admin_notes + reassign PCO) → PCO revises
  └─→ Archived (Admin) → Completed but not for client

Declined → Draft (System reverts status when PCO re-edits)
```

### Status Transition Rules
1. **Draft → Pending**: 
   - Validate all required data complete
   - Auto-unassign PCO from client
   - Send notification to admin

2. **Pending → Approved**:
   - Admin only
   - Set reviewed_by and reviewed_at
   - Cannot be edited after approval

3. **Pending → Declined**:
   - Admin only
   - **MUST provide admin_notes**
   - **MUST reassign PCO to client**
   - Send notification to PCO with admin_notes

4. **Pending → Archived**:
   - Admin only
   - For completed services not sent to client

---

## Endpoint Count Correction

**Original Estimate**: 15+ endpoints  
**Actual Required**: **22 endpoints** (confirmed from SQL guides)

### Breakdown
- Core Report CRUD: 7 endpoints
- Admin Approval: 3 endpoints
- Bait Stations: 4 endpoints
- Fumigation: 2 endpoints
- Insect Monitors: 3 endpoints
- Pre-fill/Export: 3 endpoints

---

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Minimum 30+ Tests Required

**Critical Test Scenarios**:
1. Auto-unassign after submission (verify assignment status = 'inactive')
2. Reassign on decline (verify assignment status = 'active')
3. Draft visibility (admin should not see drafts in list)
4. PCO cannot edit pending reports (403 error)
5. Admin can edit any status reports
6. Pre-fill from last approved report only
7. Chemical usage type validation (bait vs fumigation)
8. Station number uniqueness per location
9. Status transition validation (prevent invalid transitions)
10. Admin notes required for decline

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core CRUD (CRITICAL)
- Must implement auto-unassign logic
- Must implement draft visibility filter
- Must validate PCO assignment before creation

### Phase 2: Bait Stations (HIGH)
- Must implement station_chemicals nested creation
- Must validate chemical usage types
- Must enforce unique station numbers per location

### Phase 3: Fumigation & Monitors (HIGH)
- Must implement multi-table updates (areas, pests, chemicals)
- Must validate at least 1 area and 1 pest
- Must use correct insect_monitors schema

### Phase 4: Admin Workflow (CRITICAL)
- Must implement reassignment on decline
- Must validate admin_notes required
- Must implement notification triggers

### Phase 5: Pre-fill & Export (MEDIUM)
- Must query last approved report by client_id
- Must implement data copying logic
- Must allow PCO modifications

- Include direct link to pending report
- Priority based on submission age

### Push Notifications (PCO Mobile)
- **Report Declined**: "Report for [Client] requires revision"
- Include admin_notes in notification
- Show in PCO dashboard "Reports Needing Revision"

### In-App Notifications
- Real-time status updates
- Assignment changes
- Admin actions on reports

---

## Database Integrity Rules

### Foreign Key Cascade Rules
```sql
reports.client_id → clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
reports.pco_id → users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
reports.reviewed_by → users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL

bait_stations.report_id → reports(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
station_chemicals.station_id → bait_stations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
station_chemicals.chemical_id → chemicals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

fumigation_areas.report_id → reports(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
fumigation_target_pests.report_id → reports(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
fumigation_chemicals.report_id → reports(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
insect_monitors.report_id → reports(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

### Unique Constraints
```sql
-- Bait stations: unique per location per report
UNIQUE KEY unique_station_per_report (report_id, location, station_number)
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Complex Queries Required
- Report listing with JOIN to clients and users
- Report details with all sub-modules (5+ JOINs)
- Pre-fill queries across multiple tables
- Dashboard metrics with aggregations

### Optimization Strategy
- Use indexes on foreign keys
- Implement pagination (25 per page)
- Cache dashboard metrics
- Optimize GROUP_CONCAT queries for chemicals

### Response Time Goals
- Report list: < 200ms
- Report details: < 500ms
- Pre-fill data: < 300ms
- Submit report: < 1000ms (includes unassignment + notifications)
